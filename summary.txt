Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learningThe adjective in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the networkDeep learning architectures, such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, deep reinforcement learning, recurrent neural networks, and convolutional neural networks, have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition , natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, materials inspection, and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to, and in some cases superior to, expert human performanceArtificial neural networks (ANNs) were inspired by the information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systemsSpecifically, neural networks tend to be static and symbolic, while the biological brain of most living organisms is dynamic (plastic) and analog
